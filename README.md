# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## What is a Data Structure?

A **Data Structure** is a way to store and organize data in memory so that it can be used efficiently.  
Examples include:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables

---

## What is an Algorithm?

An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.  
Examples include:

- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Path-finding algorithms

### Real-World Algorithm Examples:

- Finding the fastest route in a GPS system
- Cruise control in cars or planes
- Search engine query predictions
- Sorting movies by rating

---

## Where is DSA Needed?

Data Structures and Algorithms are used in nearly every software system:

- Managing large data (e.g., social networks, search engines)
- Scheduling tasks in operating systems
- Planning routes (GPS navigation)
- Optimizing processes (e.g., packing problems, job scheduling)
- Enabling machine learning and AI
